/**
 * Source-of-truth event union for the iedora identity webhook system.
 *
 * Genkan (the IdP) emits these; first-party products consume them via the
 * receiver in this same package. Adding a new event = extending this union
 * here (the only place) — both sides pick it up via TS narrowing.
 *
 * Payload field names use snake_case so the wire form is friendly to the
 * non-TS consumers we expect (a future .NET API, a Go service). The TS
 * helpers `IdentityEventOf<E>` give back the strongly-typed payload for a
 * given event tag.
