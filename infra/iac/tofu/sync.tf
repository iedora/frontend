# Day-2 compose / Caddyfile delivery.
#
# Hash-triggered single SSH session. When `local.compose_yaml` or
# `local.caddyfile` change, this resource fires once: scp the new files
# to /etc/iedora/, then `systemctl restart iedora.service` which re-runs
# `docker compose up -d --remove-orphans` (idempotent, reconciles drift).
#
# This is the ONLY SSH on Tofu's apply graph. Default parallelism is
# safe — there's no fan-out, no MaxStartups concern, no host-key dance.

  # Reconcile.
  #   - `daemon-reload` picks up any change to the unit file.
  #   - `reload` runs ExecReload = `docker compose up -d --remove-
  #     orphans` — only containers whose config changed get recreated.
  #     `restart` would Stop+Start the whole stack via ExecStop=
  #     docker compose down, taking postgres + zitadel down for no
  #     reason.
  #   - `|| start` covers the case where the service isn't yet active
  #     (a fresh-box first apply where cloud-init beat us to it leaves
  #     it active, but a crashed/disabled box may not).
  #   - The Caddyfile is bind-mounted, so a compose-up reconcile does
  #     NOT recreate caddy when only the file content changes (the
  #     container spec is unchanged). Caddy keeps serving the old
  #     config from memory. `caddy reload` tells the running daemon
  #     to re-read `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`. Best-effort — if caddy
  #     isn't running yet, the systemctl start above will boot it
  #     fresh with the new file.
